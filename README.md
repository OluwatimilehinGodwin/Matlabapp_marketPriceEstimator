# Matlabapp_marketPriceEstimator
This repo contains my first Matlab competition submission, and my first app built with matlab app builder. this submission was made for the 2024 Matlab Universities Competiton.

**App Outline**

**Overall Objective**
We aim to create a simple, accessible app that helps farmers estimate potential market prices for their crops, empowering them with vital financial and market insights.

**What problem does it solve?**
• Sustainability: Farmers often lack access to critical market data, leading to unsustainable practices and missed opportunities for maximizing revenue. This app helps farmers improve their decision-making, ensuring a sustainable and profitable farming practice.
• Offline Accessibility: Unlike other tools, this app works offline, allowing farmers in remote areas to predict prices even without internet access. It's designed for rural areas where connectivity may be limited.
• Financial Literacy: Many farmers struggle with poor financial planning and limited understanding of market trends. The app educates them by providing real-time advice, historical price trends, and predictive
insights, helping them make sound financial choices.

**Why is it better than current solutions?**
• It works seamlessly without the need for an internet connection unlike other solutions hosted on the web.
• It has a clean, simple, and intuitive design tailored for farmers with limited tech experience. It allows farmers to select from a variety of markets, showing them price estimates for different locations, which is particularly useful for farmers who might have the flexibility to sell in multiple
areas.
• It features a visually appealing plot of historical and predicted prices, allowing farmers to see trends over time in a way that's easy to understand.

**Features:**
• Intuitive Data Visualization: On-screen plot that visually represents historical and predicted market prices, making it easier for farmers to understand trends at a glance.
• A dedicated "Tip Scroll" section offering guidance on finance, sustainability, and efficient crop management tailored to the selected crop.
• Tool Tips for Easy Navigation: Tooltips are available throughout the app, explaining each feature in simple terms and guiding users to make full use of its functionalities.
• User-friendly descriptions of each input (e.g., yield, market selection) help farmers understand what's required, reducing the learning curve.
• Market Variety for Pricing: Allows farmers to choose from a range of markets, helping them understand the price variations in different locations.
• User-Controlled Predictions: Farmers input expected yield and select the type of produce, and the app generates predicted prices based on that data.
